        With more than 15 years in the international package delivery company, Express World Wide I know how important 
        customer satisfaction and interaction is with a delivery of a package to ensure you are satisfied with the 
        delivery and condition of the package. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So I started my own small private package delivery business, On The Spot and has grown into the local community 
        to provide quality package delivery service with over 1,500 deliveries since our formation. Our values are 
        determined to provide our service around your timetable. We understand people are busy, so that’s why we cater 
        our deliveries around your day and you choose the time and day when you want your package delivered to ensure 
        the package is delivered safely and when you need it.

        The online order form includes every detail of your package including weight, location, pick-up, delivery and
        allows you to place an order form any hour of the day and helps us determine the costs and interaction
        required if your package is valuable. This form increases our business order processing by 23% which means 
        the faster we can process your order, the faster you can receive your service and ultimately be satisfied with
        the delivery.
